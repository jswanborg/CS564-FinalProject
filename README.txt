To run this program, you will need to install Python and the following extensions:
nicegui, astropy, plotly, numpy, mysql.connector, pandas

(I tried to make it executable as a standalone app but could not get that working in time)

Also, make sure you update the database connection details appropriately (the username/password should still function) at the top of main.py
